- 👋 Hi, I’m @Xenotriver;
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science and gaming, I'm more inclined to play Minecraft, Kerbal Space Program and Simple Rockets 2 than CSGO though;
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and Python, both in school, however I seem to understand Python more;
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple school projects, I can't take on serious projects yet;
- 📫 How to reach me: xenotriver@gmail.com, as well as Xenotriver#5220 on Discord (although sometimes pings don't show up for me)
